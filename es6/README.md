# ECMAScript2015(ES6)

* 1995: JavaScript is born as LiveScript
* 1997: ECMAScript standard is established
* 1999: ES3 comes out and IE5 is all the rage
* 2000–2005: XMLHttpRequest, a.k.a. AJAX, gains popularity in app such as Outlook Web Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002), Gmail (2004) and Google Maps (2005).
* 2009: ES5 comes out (this is what most of us use now) with forEach, Object.keys, Object.create (specially for Douglas Crockford), and standard JSON
* 2015: ES6/ECMAScript2015 comes out; it has mostly syntactic sugar, because people weren’t able to agree on anything more ground breaking (ES7?)
